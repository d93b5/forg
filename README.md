# Forg is a free pdf organizer for e-ink note-taking devices

It is created for my own needs: 

 - One page of notes per day
 - Calendar view divided per quarter


It has been tested only on Remarkable 2. 

The current release (october 2022 - December 2023) is available [Here](https://github.com/d93b5/forg/releases/download/Q42022/forg.pdf)

# Contributing

## Test
The PDF file has been tested only on Remarkable 2. Please let me know if it works on other devices by adding a post  [here](https://github.com/d93b5/forg/discussions)

## Modify
This project is a small LaTeX file `forg.tex`. It is about 150 lines long. You can easily modify the template (change the dates, add your own vacation etc.)
Windows users who want to build their own PDF file can install [minktex](https://miktex.org/download), then [texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
