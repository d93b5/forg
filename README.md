# Forg is a free pdf organizer for e-ink note-taking devices

It is created for my own needs: 

 - One page of notes per day
 - Calendar view divided per quarter


It has been tested only on Remarkable 2, but should work with any devices.

The current release (october 2022 - December 2023) is available [Here](https://github.com/d93b5/forg/releases/download/Q42022/forg.pdf)
